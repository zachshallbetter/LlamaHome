2. **Status Update**: Within 72 hours
3. **Resolution Timeline**: Typically within 7-14 days

### Security Update Process

1. Security issue is reported
2. Issue is confirmed and prioritized
3. Fix is developed and tested
4. Security advisory is prepared
5. Fix is deployed and announced

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Authentication**
   - Use strong passwords
   - Enable two-factor authentication
   - Regularly rotate credentials
   - Never share API keys

2. **API Security**
   - Use HTTPS for all API calls
   - Implement proper rate limiting
   - Validate all input
   - Handle errors securely

3. **Data Protection**
   - Encrypt sensitive data
   - Regularly backup data
   - Implement access controls
   - Monitor access logs

### For Developers

1. **Code Security**

   ```python
   # Good: Input validation
   def process_input(data: str) -> str:
       """Process user input safely."""
       if not isinstance(data, str):
           raise ValueError("Input must be string")
       return sanitize_input(data)
   
   # Bad: No input validation
   def process_input(data):
       return data.strip()
   ```

2. **Authentication Implementation**

   ```python
   # Good: Secure token validation
   def validate_token(token: str) -> bool:
       """Validate authentication token."""
       try:
           payload = jwt.decode(
               token,
               secret_key,
               algorithms=["HS256"]
           )
           return verify_payload(payload)
       except jwt.InvalidTokenError:
           return False
   ```

3. **Error Handling**

   ```python
   # Good: Secure error handling
   def handle_error(error: Exception) -> Response:
       """Handle errors securely."""
       logger.error(f"Error: {error}")
       return Response(
           status="error",
           message="An error occurred",
           code=500
       )
   ```

## Security Features

### Authentication

1. **Token-based Authentication**

   ```python
   class AuthHandler:
       """Handle authentication."""
       
       def create_token(
           self,
           user_id: str,
           expires_in: int = 3600
       ) -> str:
           """Create authentication token."""
           return generate_secure_token(user_id, expires_in)
   ```

2. **Role-based Access Control**

   ```python
   class AccessControl:
       """Control access to resources."""
       
       def check_permission(
           self,
           user: User,
           resource: str,
           action: str
       ) -> bool:
           """Check user permissions."""
           return user.has_permission(resource, action)
   ```

### Data Protection

1. **Encryption**

   ```python
   class DataEncryption:
       """Handle data encryption."""
       
       def encrypt_data(
           self,
           data: bytes,
           key: bytes
       ) -> bytes:
           """Encrypt sensitive data."""
           return encrypt_with_key(data, key)
   ```

2. **Secure Storage**

   ```python
   class SecureStorage:
       """Handle secure data storage."""
       
       def store_securely(
           self,
           data: Dict[str, Any],
           user_id: str
       ) -> None:
           """Store data securely."""
           encrypted = self.encrypt(data)
           self.store(user_id, encrypted)
   ```

## Security Monitoring

### Logging

1. **Security Events**

   ```python
   class SecurityLogger:
       """Log security events."""
       
       def log_security_event(
           self,
           event_type: str,
           details: Dict[str, Any]
       ) -> None:
           """Log security event."""
           logger.security(
               event_type,
               extra=details
           )
   ```

2. **Audit Trail**

   ```python
   class AuditTrail:
       """Maintain audit trail."""
       
       def record_action(
           self,
           user: User,
           action: str,
           resource: str
       ) -> None:
           """Record user action."""

# Security Guide

## Automated Security Checks

We use several automated tools to ensure code security:

### Trunk Security Scanning

Our Trunk configuration includes security-focused tools:

- **trufflehog**: Scans for secrets and sensitive data
  - Runs on all PRs and pushes
  - Ignores test files and documentation
  - Configured to detect various token formats

- **bandit**: Python security linter
  - Checks for common security issues
  - Custom rules for our codebase
  - Integrated with CI/CD

- **git-diff-check**: Prevents accidental commits of sensitive data
  - Runs pre-commit
  - Checks for large binary files
  - Validates line endings

See [.trunk/README.md](../.trunk/README.md) for security tool configuration.
