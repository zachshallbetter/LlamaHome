# Training Architecture

## Design Decisions

### Data Pipeline

The training pipeline uses a streaming approach with async processing:

```python
class TrainingPipeline:
    """
    Streaming pipeline with:
    1. Async data loading
    2. Prefetch queue
    3. Dynamic batching
    4. Resource monitoring
    """
```

Key considerations:

- Memory efficiency over processing speed
- Disk I/O optimization
- Resource-aware scheduling

### State Management

Training state persistence uses a tiered approach:

```python
class TrainingState:
    """
    Tiered state management:
    1. In-memory cache (active)
    2. Disk cache (recent)
    3. Archive (historical)
    
    State transitions based on:
    - Memory pressure
    - Access patterns
    - Training phase
    """
```

### Integration Points

Core hooks for pipeline customization:

1. Data Loading:
   - Custom dataset formats
   - Preprocessing plugins
   - Validation rules

2. Training Loop:
   - Custom callbacks
   - Metric collection
   - Resource monitoring

3. State Management:
   - Checkpoint strategies
   - Recovery handlers
   - Cache policies

## Performance Considerations

### Memory Management

Training uses a hybrid memory strategy:

1. Active Memory:
   - Current batch
   - Model states
   - Gradients

2. Cache Memory:
   - Recent batches
   - Validation data
   - Metrics

3. Disk Storage:
   - Historical data
   - Checkpoints
   - Archived metrics

### Resource Optimization

Automatic resource balancing:

```python
class ResourceManager:
    """
    Balances:
    1. GPU memory
    2. CPU utilization
    3. Disk I/O
    4. Network bandwidth
    
    Adjusts:
    - Batch size
    - Prefetch depth
    - Cache policy
    """
```

## Error Handling

Critical paths use specialized exceptions:

```python
class TrainingError(Exception):
    """Base class for training errors."""
    pass

class DataError(TrainingError):
    """Data pipeline errors."""
    pass

class StateError(TrainingError):
    """State management errors."""
    pass
```

## Testing Strategy

Key test areas:

1. Data Pipeline:

   ```python
   @pytest.mark.asyncio
   async def test_streaming():
       """Verify streaming performance."""
   ```

2. State Management:

   ```python
   def test_checkpoint_recovery():
       """Verify state recovery."""
   ```

3. Resource Usage:

   ```python
   @pytest.mark.gpu
   def test_memory_optimization():
       """Verify memory efficiency."""
   ```

## Configuration

Training configuration focuses on critical parameters:

```yaml
training:
  pipeline:
    batch_size: "auto"  # Dynamic based on resources
    prefetch: 2         # Number of batches to prefetch
    max_memory: 0.8     # Maximum memory utilization

  optimization:
    mixed_precision: true
    gradient_checkpointing: true
    compile_mode: "reduce-overhead"

  resources:
    gpu_memory_fraction: 0.9
    cpu_workers: "auto"
    io_queue_size: 1000
```

## Known Limitations

1. Resource Constraints:
   - Memory scales with batch size
   - I/O bottlenecks with large datasets
   - GPU memory fragmentation

2. Performance Tradeoffs:
   - Streaming vs. caching
   - Precision vs. memory
   - Checkpoint frequency

## Future Considerations

1. Optimizations:
   - Improved memory mapping
   - Better I/O scheduling
   - Enhanced state persistence

2. Integration Points:
   - Custom data formats
   - Pipeline plugins
   - Monitoring hooks
