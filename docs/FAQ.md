## Installation

### How do I install LlamaHome?

1. **Clone Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/zachshallbetter/llamahome.git
   cd llamahome
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   # Setup environment and install dependencies
   make setup
   ```

### What are the system requirements?

Minimum requirements:
- CPU: 4 cores, 2.5GHz+
- RAM: 16GB
- Storage: 50GB SSD
- GPU: 8GB VRAM (for 7B model)

Recommended requirements:
- CPU: 8+ cores, 3.5GHz+
- RAM: 32GB
- Storage: 100GB NVMe SSD
- GPU: 24GB VRAM (for 13B model)

### Can I use LlamaHome without a GPU?

Yes, LlamaHome can run on CPU-only systems, but performance will be significantly slower. GPU acceleration is recommended for optimal performance.

## Configuration

### How do I configure LlamaHome?

1. **Project Configuration**

   Configuration is managed through `pyproject.toml`:
   ```toml
   [project]
   name = "llamahome"
   version = "0.1.0"
   requires-python = ">=3.11"

   [project.dependencies]
   torch = ">=2.0.0"
   transformers = ">=4.30.0"
   ```

2. **Environment Configuration**

   ```bash
   # Copy example configuration
   cp .env.example .env
   
   # Edit configuration
   nano .env
   ```

### Where are configuration files stored?

- `pyproject.toml`: Core project configuration
- `.env`: Environment variables
- `.config/`: Additional configuration files

### How do I manage dependencies?

Dependencies are managed through `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[project.dependencies]
torch = ">=2.0.0"
transformers = ">=4.30.0"

[project.optional-dependencies]
dev = [
    "pytest>=7.4.0",
    "black>=23.3.0",
]
```

## Model Management

### Which models are supported?

Currently supported models:

- Llama 3.3 (7B, 13B, 70B variants)
- More models coming soon

### How do I download models?

```bash
# Download specific model
make download MODEL=llama3.3-7b

# Download all models
make download-all
```

### How do I manage model storage?

```bash
# List installed models
make list-models

# Remove specific model
make remove MODEL=llama3.3-7b

# Clean all models
make clean-models
```

## Performance

### How can I optimize performance?

1. **Memory Optimization**
   - Enable smart caching
   - Use memory-mapped files
   - Optimize batch size

2. **GPU Optimization**
   - Enable quantization
   - Adjust GPU layers
   - Use H2O optimization

### What affects model speed?

Key factors:
- Hardware capabilities
- Model size
- Batch size
- Optimization settings
- Input complexity

### How do I monitor performance?

```bash
# Run performance monitoring
make monitor

# Generate performance report
make report
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Installation Fails**
   ```text
   Q: Setup fails
   A: Ensure Python 3.11 is installed and active
   ```

2. **Model Loading Fails**
   ```text
   Q: Model fails to load
   A: Check GPU memory and model requirements
   ```

3. **Out of Memory**
   ```text
   Q: GPU out of memory error
   A: Reduce batch size or enable memory optimization
   ```
