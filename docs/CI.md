This document outlines our CI/CD pipeline implemented with GitHub Actions.

## Overview

Our CI pipeline ensures code quality, runs tests, and maintains security standards through automated checks and validations.

## Workflows

### 1. Test Pipeline (`test-pipeline.yml`)

The test pipeline runs our test suite and reports coverage.

#### Jobs

1. **Main Test Job**
   ```yaml
   env:
     PYTHONPATH: ${{ github.workspace }}
     COVERAGE_FILE: coverage.xml
   ```
   - Runs on Ubuntu latest
   - Uses Python 3.11
   - Executes unit tests with coverage
   - Uploads test results and coverage reports
   - Integrates with Codecov

2. **Distributed Tests**
   - Runs after main tests complete
   - Tests distributed functionality
   - Uploads distributed test results

#### Test Categories
- Unit Tests
- Integration Tests
- Performance Tests
- Specialized Tests
- Distributed Tests

#### Artifacts
- Coverage Reports (XML and HTML)
- Test Results
- Performance Metrics
- Distributed Test Results

### 2. Code Quality (`trunk-check.yml`)

Ensures code quality through automated checks.

#### Features
- Code formatting validation
- Static type checking
- Security scanning
- Linting
- Style enforcement

#### Tools
- **black**: Code formatting (line length: 88)
- **isort**: Import sorting
- **mypy**: Static type checking
- **ruff**: Fast Python linter
- **bandit**: Security scanning
- **prettier**: General formatting
- **trufflehog**: Secret detection

## Security

### Permissions

All workflows use explicit permissions following the principle of least privilege:

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read      # Read repository contents
  checks: write       # Write check results
  actions: read       # Read Actions data
  pull-requests: write # Write PR comments (for Codecov)
```

### Security Features
- Pinned action versions
- Secret scanning
- Dependency validation
- Code security analysis

## Configuration

### Environment Setup
```yaml
env:
  PYTHONPATH: ${{ github.workspace }}
  COVERAGE_FILE: coverage.xml
```

### Python Dependencies
```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install pytest pytest-cov coverage
pip install -e ".[test]"
```

## Local Development

### Running Tests Locally

```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Run specific test suites
make test-unit
make test-integration
make test-performance

# Run with coverage
make test-coverage
```

### Code Quality Checks

```bash
# Run all checks
trunk check

# Format code
trunk fmt

# Run specific linter
trunk check --filter=black
```

## Continuous Deployment

Currently implemented deployment stages:
- Test execution
- Code quality validation
- Security scanning
- Coverage reporting

Future planned stages:
- Automated releases
- Docker image builds
- Environment deployments

## Best Practices

1. **Commits**
   - Follow conventional commit format
   - Include relevant test updates
   - Keep changes focused

2. **Pull Requests**
   - Wait for all checks to pass
   - Address security findings
   - Maintain test coverage

3. **Code Quality**
   - Run formatters before committing
   - Address all linter warnings
   - Follow type hints

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Test Failures**
   ```bash
   # Run tests with verbose output
   pytest -v
   
   # Run specific failed test
   pytest path/to/test.py::test_name -v
   ```

2. **Coverage Issues**
   ```bash
   # Generate detailed coverage report
   coverage report --show-missing
   ```

3. **Linting Errors**
   ```bash
   # Run specific linter
   trunk check --filter=black path/to/file.py
   ```

### CI Pipeline Failures

1. Check the GitHub Actions logs
2. Verify local tests pass
3. Ensure all dependencies are properly specified
4. Validate environment variables

## Monitoring

### Metrics Tracked
- Test coverage percentage
- Build success rate
- Test execution time
- Security findings
- Code quality scores

### Reporting
- Codecov integration
- GitHub Security tab
- Actions workflow summary
- Artifact retention

## Future Improvements

1. **Pipeline Optimization**
   - Parallel test execution
   - Improved caching
   - Faster builds

2. **Security Enhancements**
   - SAST integration
   - Dependency scanning
   - Container scanning

3. **Automation**
   - Release automation
   - Change log generation
   - Version management
